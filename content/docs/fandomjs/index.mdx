title: Fandom.js Overview
description: Understand what ships in the fandom.js package, who it is for, and how the pieces fit together.
---

Fandom.js is a lightweight, fully typed client for MediaWiki and Fandom wikis. It wraps the `action=query`
and `Articles/Details` APIs, adds a resilient request manager, and exposes high-level managers for pages,
users, revisions, categories, search, metadata, and wiki events.

## Key capabilities

- **Page management** — fetch summaries, content, categories, history, and revert or edit articles in place.
- **User and revision utilities** — inspect contributor groups, recent changes, and block or rollback activity.
- **Search and categories** — run relevance queries, list category members, or stitch your own navigation data.
- **Event polling** — listen to `pageUpdate`, `pageCreate`, `fileUpload`, and `userBlock` events without
  touching the RecentChanges API yourself.
- **Node 18+ + ESM** — modern runtime expectations with native `fetch`, `URL`, and top-level `await` support.

  The code published in this repository is exactly what ships to npm. Every example below is backed by real
  source files under `src/` so you can trust the behavior described in these docs.

## Works on any wiki

The client does not hard-code a single community. Point `host` at any Fandom-supported wiki and the managers
talk to its `/api.php` endpoint. Switching wikis is as simple as changing the host URL.

```ts
import { Client } from 'fandom.js';

const client = new Client({
  host: 'https://sonic.fandom.com',
  apiPath: '/api.php',
});

const page = await client.pages.fetch('Sonic_the_Hedgehog');
console.log(page.extract);
```

## Feature map

| Manager | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pages` | High-level wrapper around queries that pull article text, categories, and revisions with caching. |
| `users` | Fetch user profiles and contribution lists, then block accounts through the same instance. |
| `revisions` | Inspect a specific revision ID or gather recent changes for dashboards. |
| `search` | Call MediaWiki search and get normalized titles back to hydrate your own UI. |
| `categories` | Enumerate `Category:` members and hydrate them as `Page` structures. |
| `meta` | Access siteinfo for namespaces, statistics, or general wiki metadata. |
| `events` | EventEmitter that continuously polls RecentChanges and emits typed events.

## Quick start

```ts
import { Client } from 'fandom.js';

const client = new Client({
  host: 'https://wingsoffire.fandom.com',
  polling: false,
});

client.events.on('ready', () => console.log('Client ready'));
client.events.on('pageUpdate', (change) => {
  console.log(`[${change.timestamp}] ${change.title} edited by ${change.user}`);
});

await client.login();
const recent = await client.revisions.fetchRecent(5);
console.log(recent.map((rev) => rev.title));
```
